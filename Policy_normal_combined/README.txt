This time:
Ingestor public on Hub Topic 
The hub gets the published alert and selects the destinations, namely the CBE topic or the Exporter Topic


For testing:
After running containers, execute the hub.py and then the ingestor.py.
To conclude the hub.py execute again the ingestor.by (ToDo: debug)
